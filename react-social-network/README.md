The React Social Network is an open source project relying on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html) a powerful javascript library for building the user interface. In this project, I tried to show some features of react/react components as a social network. 
The structure of this project give the ability to developer to develop their project on their own idea and environment.

## Document

 Comming soon :) ...

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Installing

## What is new? :star2:
### Structure
New structure could make the project easy to change and scale up.
There are three main layers:
 - [Core](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/tree/v0.7.0/src/core) 
   - [Domain](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/tree/v0.7.0/src/core/domain)
   - [Providing interface for data services](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/tree/v0.7.0/src/core/services)
 - [Data](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/tree/v0.7.0/src/data)
  - This layer provide supporting variety of data platforms such as [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), ... .
    - [FirestoreClient](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/tree/v0.7.0/src/data/firestoreClient)
    - AwsClient
    - AspNetClient
    - ...
 - [Components](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/tree/v0.7.0/src/components)
  - This layer take care of user interface which on [React](https://reactjs.org) and in [react-mobile-social] on [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). It means **the only thing change here among these three layers on mobile app, is component layer**.

### IOC Container
  - Using [InversifyJS](http://inversify.io/) in project give us the ability to switch between custom dependencies easily. Specially for *data layer*, if you are the user working with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) you only need to call `useAws()` or using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) call `useFirestore()` in [SocialEngine](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/blob/v0.7.0/src/socialEngine.ts#L20) file.
### Features
  - We moved from custom webpack to [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
  - Moving on [redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) managing async request and side effects.
  - Supporting [Async Component/Lazy loading](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#code-splitting) for each container.
  - Support Localization by [react-localize-redux](https://github.com/ryandrewjohnson/react-localize-redux). Providing this feature we support variety of languages. To contribute :heart: your language you are able to add your local language. You only need to edit `en.json` from `react-social-network` root project and `src/locale/en.json`. You should name your file according ISO 639-1 Language Codes. For example for Spanish you should name `es.json`. Which `es` is the standard code of Spanish language.
  - [InversifyJS](http://inversify.io/) as IOC container
  - Add auto compile on changing code for `webpack`
  - Open browser on after compiling on `npm start`. You need to set `PORT=[PORT_NUMBER]` in [config file](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/blob/v0.7.0/docs/app/configure/development.env).
  - Add reset password, confirm password and authorizing by GitHub, Google and Facebook.
  - Add scroll auto loading for show posts and people pages.
  - Using [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/)
  - Supportig `Right To Left`
  - Some cool stuff :)
## Can I connect React Social Network to other data platforms ? :bowtie:
  Your server side is on `PHP`, `Java`,`ASP.NET`, `Python`, etc. Or you are using serverless platforms such as `Google Cloud`, `AWS`, `Azure`, etc. You can connect `React Social Network` to any data platform. You only need to implement the [interfaces of core services](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/tree/v0.7.0/src/core/services) like implementation of [firestoreClient](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/tree/v0.7.0/src/data/firestoreClient).
  
  There are a summary steps of creating your own `dataClients`. We assume that we want to implement for `PHP` backend.
  
  * You need to know about [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/samples/index.html) and implementing interfaces which I recommend take a look at [this article](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html).
  
  * You can get help from other [dataClient](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/tree/v0.7.0/src/data) implementation for your backend algorithm and also using [core domain](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/tree/v0.7.0/src/core/domain) for the backend domain could be helpful.
  
  1. Create a folder in [data layer](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/tree/v0.7.0/src/data) name `phpClient`.
  2. Create a folder in `/phpClient` folder name `services` then in `services` folder create some folders following [core/services folder](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/tree/v0.7.0/src/core/services) such as `services/votes`, `services/posts` and etc.
  3. In each folder inside `/phpClient/services/*` folder you should implement following interfaces in `core/services/*` folder in file with appropriate name. For example we need to implement `IPostService` from `core/services/posts/IPostService.ts` in `data/phpClient/services/posts/PostService.ts` file.
  4. After implementing interfaces for services layer. We should register the dependencies for our `phpClient` services. Create a file in `phpClient` folder name `dependecyRegisterar.ts`.
  5. Following `firestoreClient` dependencies, add a function name `usePhp()` and bind dependencies in the the function. For example for `PostService` class add `container.bind<IPostService>(SocialProviderTypes.PostService).to(PostService)`. Here `SocialProviderTypes` has the identifier of each service. To learn more take a look at [inversify docs](http://inversify.io/).
  6. Finally call registering dependencies function for in [socialEngine](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/blob/v0.7.0/src/socialEngine.ts#L22) file.
  7. Enjoy ;)

> :heart_eyes: It also would be great if you could contribute your `clientData` and `backend` with us to be part of this contribution. We would appreciate any conntribution.:thumbsup:


## Deployment
- In command line of [react-social-network] root project, type [firebase login](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/). This command connects your local machine to your Firebase account and grants access to your projects. To test that authentication worked, you can run firebase list to see a list of all of your Firebase projects. The list should be the same as the projects listed at [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
- Be sure the name of firebase project for [react-social-network] and this project is same. You also need to check `.firebaserc` if you set correct project name in `default` field of `projects` field.
  ```bash
  npm run deploy:firebase
  ```
- Please checkout [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#deployment) for more deployment solution.

  * [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) Create React App is a tool built by developers at Facebook to help you build React applications. It saves you from time-consuming setup and configuration. You simply run one command and create react app sets up the tools you need to start your React project.
